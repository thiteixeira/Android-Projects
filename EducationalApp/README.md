This APP shows examples of using `ScrollView`, `RadioButton`, `CheckBox`, `TextView`, display `Toast`, and `Intent` to email app.

The user is presented with six questions regarding wine. Each question is worth one point. At the end, the `Grade` button presents a `Toast` with the total score. The `Submit` button sends an `Intent` and opens the default email App with the total score in the text.
